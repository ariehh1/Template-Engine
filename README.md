In this repository, I have created a Command Line Application that simulates the makeup of an Engineering Team. The team members include a Manager, Employee, Engineer, and Intern. The most updated team information will display within the application. Please build your team!

This repository expanded my knowledge on node.js and server side applications. One of the new syntaxes that I read and integrated into my application was Mustache. One can utilize Mustache.js to render templates in JavaScript. It is "logic-less" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags.

<h1>Setup:</h1>
As the application runs in node, the user should first type "npm i". Then "node app.js" to render the command prompts.

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue developing the application, I would add in more persona profiles for granularity. Within the Engineering team for example, there are Junior Developers, Mid-Level, etc. They each would personify a different set of technical skills and expertise.
